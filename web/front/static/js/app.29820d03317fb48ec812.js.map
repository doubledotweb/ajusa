Orgánica, legislación sectorial específica y sus normas de desarrollo).</p>\r\n          <br>\r\n          <p>La Política de Protección de Datos de AUTOJUNTAS SAU descansa en el principio de

ante las autoridades de control competentes.</p>\r\n          <br>\r\n          <p>En tal sentido, el responsable del tratamiento se regirá por los siguientes principios que deben servir a todo su personal como guía y marco de referencia en el tratamiento de datos personales:</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">1.  Protección de datos desde el diseño: </span> el responsable del tratamiento aplicará, tanto en el momento de determinar los medios de tratamiento como en el momento del propio tratamiento, medidas técnicas y organizativas apropiadas, como la seudonimización, concebidas para aplicar de forma efectiva los principios de protección de datos, como la minimización de datos, e integrar las garantías necesarias en el tratamiento. </p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">2.  Protección de datos por defecto:</span>el responsable del tratamiento aplicará las medidas técnicas y organizativas apropiadas con miras a garantizar que, por defecto, solo sean objeto de tratamiento los datos personales que sean necesarios para cada uno de los fines específicos del tratamiento.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">3.  Protección de datos en el ciclo de vida de la información:</span> las medidas que garanticen la protección de los datos personales serán aplicables durante el ciclo completo de la vida de la información.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">4.  Licitud, lealtad y transparencia:</span> los datos personales serán tratados de manera lícita, leal y transparente en relación con el interesado. </p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">5.  Limitación de la finalidad:</span> los datos personales serán recogidos con fines determinados, explícitos y legítimos, y no serán tratados ulteriormente de manera incompatible con dichos fines.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">6.  Minimización de datos:</span> los datos personales serán adecuados, pertinentes y limitados a lo necesario en relación con los fines para los que son tratados.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">7.  Exactitud:</span>los datos personales serán exactos y, si fuera necesario, actualizados; se adoptarán todas las medidas razonables para que se supriman o rectifiquen sin dilación los datos personales que sean inexactos con respecto a los fines para los que se tratan.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">8.  Limitación del plazo de conservación:</span>los datos personales serán mantenidos de forma que se permita la identificación de los interesados durante no más tiempo del necesario para los fines del tratamiento de los datos personales.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">9.  Integridad y confidencialidad:</span> los datos personales serán tratados de tal manera que se garantice una seguridad adecuada de los datos personales, incluida la protección contra el tratamiento no autorizado o ilícito y contra su pérdida, destrucción o daño accidental, mediante la aplicación de medidas técnicas u organizativas apropiadas. </p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">10. Información y formación:</span> una de las claves para garantizar la protección de los datos personales es la formación e información que se facilite al personal involucrado en el tratamiento de los mismos. Durante el ciclo de vida de la información, todo el personal con acceso a los datos será convenientemente formado e informado acerca de sus obligaciones en relación con el cumplimiento de la normativa de protección de datos.</p>\r\n          <br>\r\n          <p>La Política de Protección de Datos de AUTO JUNTAS SAU es comunicada a todo el personal del responsable del tratamiento y puesta a disposición de todas las partes interesadas.</p>\r\n          <br>\r\n          <p>En su consecuencia, la presente Política de Protección de Datos involucra a todo el personal del responsable del tratamiento, que debe conocerla y asumirla, considerándola como propia, siendo cada miembro responsable de aplicarla y de verificar las normas de protección de datos aplicables a su actividad, así como identificar y aportar las oportunidades de mejora que considere oportunas con el objetivo de alcanzar la excelencia en relación con su cumplimiento.</p>\r\n          <br>\r\n          <p>Esta Política será revisada por la Dirección / Órgano de Gobierno de AUTOJUNTAS SAU, tantas veces como se considere necesario, para adecuarse, en todo momento, a las disposiciones vigentes en materia de protección de datos de carácter personal.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n        \r\n      </div>\r\n    </section>\r\n\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script lang=\"js\">\r\n  export default  {\r\n    name: 'politica-privacidad',\r\n    props: [],\r\n    mounted() {\r\n\r\n    },\r\n    data() {\r\n      return {\r\n\r\n      }\r\n    },\r\n    methods: {\r\n\r\n    },\r\n    computed: {\r\n\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n  .politica-privacidad {\r\n\r\n  }\r\n</style>\r\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// src/components/views/politica-privacidad.vue","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('section',{staticClass:\"text-legal pad-sec\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"container\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"block-legal\"},[_c('h3',{staticClass:\"title title-36\"},[_vm._v(\"DATA PROTECTION POLICY\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"The Direction / Governing Body of AUTO JUNTAS SAU (hereinafter, the person responsible for the treatment), assumes the maximum responsibility and commitment to the establishment, implementation and maintenance of this Data Protection Policy, guaranteeing the continuous improvement of the data controller. the objective of achieving excellence in relation to compliance with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and the free circulation of these data and repealing Directive 95/46 / EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJEU L 119/1, 04-05-2016), and Spanish legislation on the protection of personal data (Organic Law, specific sector legislation and its development regulations).\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\" The Data Protection Policy of AUTO JUNTAS SAU relies on the principle of proactive responsibility, according to which the controller is responsible for compliance with the regulatory and jurisprudential framework that governs said Policy and is able to demonstrate it to the competent control authorities.\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('br'),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"In this sense, the person responsible for the treatment will be governed by the following principles that should serve all its personnel as a guide and frame of reference in the processing of personal data:\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('p',[_vm._v(\"1.
