personal como guía y marco de referencia en el tratamiento de datos personales:</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">1.  Protección de datos desde el diseño: </span> el responsable del tratamiento aplicará, tanto en el momento de determinar los medios de tratamiento como en el momento del propio tratamiento, medidas técnicas y organizativas apropiadas, como la seudonimización, concebidas para aplicar de forma efectiva los principios de protección de datos, como la minimización de datos, e integrar las garantías necesarias en el tratamiento. </p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">2.  Protección de datos por defecto:</span>el responsable del tratamiento aplicará las medidas técnicas y organizativas apropiadas con miras a garantizar que, por defecto, solo sean objeto de tratamiento los datos personales que sean necesarios para cada uno de los fines específicos del tratamiento.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">3.  Protección de datos en el ciclo de vida de la información:</span> las medidas que garanticen la protección de los datos personales serán aplicables durante el ciclo completo de la vida de la información.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">4.  Licitud, lealtad y transparencia:</span> los datos personales serán tratados de manera lícita, leal y transparente en relación con el interesado. </p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">5.  Limitación de la finalidad:</span> los datos personales serán recogidos con fines determinados, explícitos y legítimos, y no serán tratados ulteriormente de manera incompatible con dichos fines.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">6.  Minimización de datos:</span> los datos personales serán adecuados, pertinentes y limitados a lo necesario en relación con los fines para los que son tratados.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">7.  Exactitud:</span>los datos personales serán exactos y, si fuera necesario, actualizados; se adoptarán todas las medidas razonables para que se supriman o rectifiquen sin dilación los datos personales que sean inexactos con respecto a los fines para los que se tratan.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">8.  Limitación del plazo de conservación:</span>los datos personales serán mantenidos de forma que se permita la identificación de los interesados durante no más tiempo del necesario para los fines del tratamiento de los datos personales.</p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">9.  Integridad y confidencialidad:</span> los datos personales serán tratados de tal manera que se garantice una seguridad adecuada de los datos personales, incluida la protección contra el tratamiento no autorizado o ilícito y contra su pérdida, destrucción o daño accidental, mediante la aplicación de medidas técnicas u organizativas apropiadas. </p>\r\n          <p><span class=\"bold\">10. Información y formación:</span> una de las claves para garantizar la protección de los datos personales es la formación e información que se facilite al personal involucrado en el tratamiento de los mismos.
